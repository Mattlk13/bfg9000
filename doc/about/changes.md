# Changes

## v0.6.0
in progress
{: .subtitle}

### New features
- Add support for including multiple `build.bfg` (and `options.bfg`) files from
  subdirectories via `submodule()`
- Create `-uninstalled` variants of generated *pkg-config* `.pc` files and
  allow build scripts to use them internally
- Add `opts.gui` to generate graphical programs (important on Windows)
- Add `opts.static` to request static linking of libraries
- MSVC's runtime can now be selected by using a combination of `opts.static`
  and `opts.debug`
- Link steps (`executable`, `library`, etc) now accept an `extra_compile_deps`
  argument to forward on to the compilation step
- Iterables passed to `default` or `install` will include each element of the
  iterable in the appropriate build target
- `info()`, `debug()`, and `warning()` now take a variable number of arguments
  to print
- Add support for setting the entry point for native binaries (C, C++, etc)

### Breaking changes
- Drop support for Python 2
- `show_stack` for `info()` and `debug()` must now be specified as a keyword
  argument

### Bug fixes
- `copy_file()` now works correctly when copying into a subdirectory on the
  Make backend
- `extra_deps` now works with `copy_file()`
- Automatically-generated PCH source files (for MSVC compilers) are now placed
  in the same directory as the resulting PCH
- The `install_name` for libraries on macOS is now always an absolute path,
  instead of using `@rpath`-based paths prior to installation
- MSBuild backend can now build libraries with no source files that link to a
  whole-archive library

## v0.5.1
2019-12-07
{: .subtitle}

### Bug fixes
- Depfiles generated by compile steps are now properly included into Makefiles
- Include directories passed to via `include` and libraries passed via `libs`
  are now listed before those from `packages` when building
- Fix linking to shared libraries located in the source directory

---

## v0.5.0
2019-11-25
{: .subtitle}

### New features
- Add `generated_source()` to allow generating source code from domain-specific
  languages
- Add support for `lex`, `yacc`, and Qt build tools (`moc`, `rcc`, `uic`)
- Add the ability to use placeholders for `build_step()` and `command()`
- Add an `auto_file()` function that infers the kind of file based on its
  extension; `build_step()` now uses this by default for outputs
- Add `always_outdated` argument to `build_step()`
- Add `copy_file()` and `copy_files()` functions
- `default()` now returns the files passed into it
- `install()` now returns the installed forms of the files passed into it
- Add `safe_str()` and `safe_format()` to help safely build command string
- Expose `Path` object to bfg scripts
- Add `directory` as an option for `object_file()`, `generated_source()`,
  `copy_file()`, and their list-variants
- Add `lang` and `intermediate_dirs` arguments to `project()` for modifying
  project-wide settings
- Add `srcdir` builtin to toolchain files

### Breaking changes
- `find_files()` redesigned and split into `find_files()` and `find_paths()`;
  simple cases should still work, but more complex uses will need adjusted
- *pkg-config* `.pc` files generated by bfg9000 no longer include rpath flags
- Explicitly passing `lang` to a build step now overrides the languages of any
  input files when determining the builder
- `args` and `kwargs` no longer supported for `build_step()`; use a lambda
  instead
- Options specified on the command line (e.g. install locations) now override
  settings in toolchain files
- Implicitly-defined object files (e.g. those generated by `executable()`) are
  placed in an intermediate directory; call `project(intermediate_dirs=False)`
  to disable this

### Bug fixes
- Include `options.bfg` in dist tarballs
- Fix escaping of `~` in Makefiles
- Symbolic links (e.g. from versioned shared libraries) are now properly
  installed as symlinks
- Generated header directories are now included as dependencies of compilation
  steps
- Default install locations are now based on the *target* platform instead of
  the host platform
- Shared libraries with `soversion`s can now be used with `pkg_config()`

## v0.4.1
2019-07-05
{: .subtitle}

### Bug fixes
- Fix using semantic options in `global_options`

---

## v0.4.0
2019-07-05
{: .subtitle}

### New features
- Compilers and linkers now support semantic options, abstracting away the
  differences between compiler flavors
- Add support for cross-compilation
- Toolchain files can be used to simplify setting up build configuration
  options
- Add `info`, `warn`, and `debug` builtins to let build scripts print messages
  via bfg's logging system
- `whole_archive()` now works with MSVC linkers
- Add support for module-definition files when linking `.exe` or `.dll` files
- Build steps now have a (customizable) friendly description when using the
  Ninja backend
- Makefiles generated by bfg now have a `clean` target

### Breaking changes
- MSVC builds now automatically set `/EHsc` to improve standards-compliance and
  mimic Visual Studio's default MSBuild configuration
- Paths are now parsed in a platform-agnostic manner, which may cause issues for
  certain esoteric pathnames (e.g. POSIX paths that look like Windows paths)
- `env.platform` has been split into `env.host_platform` and
  `env.target_platform`
- MinGW now makes DLLs named `<name>.dll` instead of `lib<name>.dll`
- Platform names are reworked; `'windows'` is now `'winnt'` and `'darwin'` is
  `'macos'`

### Bug fixes
- Fix support for packaging as a Python Wheel
- Default options for `ar` are now `cr` instead of `cru` to support versions of
  `ar` that default to deterministic builds
- Fix building Java projects with OpenJDK 8+
- Fix loading Boost packages from `C:\Boost` on Windows
- Libraries are linked via their absolute paths where possible to help
  disambiguate libraries with the same name

## v0.3.1
2018-06-01
{: .subtitle}

### Bug fixes
- Fix an issue with creating the build directory during the configuration
  process

---

## v0.3.0
2018-06-01
{: .subtitle}

### New features
- Replace `system_package()` and `pkgconfig_package()` with a generic package
  resolver: `package()`
- Add `headers` argument to `package()` to find header files and `libs` to
  specify library names if *pkg-config* lookup fails
- Support Java/Scala
- Add support for user-defined arguments
- Add a `library()` function that builds shared and/or static libraries per the
  user's preference
- Add support for generating *pkg-config* `.pc` files
- Allow executing files that require an interpreter or other wrapper via
  `command()` or `test()`/`test_driver()` without explicitly specifying the
  wrapper; supports all languages buildable by bfg9000, plus Lua, Perl, Python,
  and Ruby
- Add `env.run()`, `env.execute()`, and `env.run_arguments()` to simplify
  executing programs during configuration
- Add a `framework()` function to specify macOS frameworks to use for a build
- Improve detection of compiler flavors by checking version information
- Automatically colorize clang/gcc output under Ninja
- Add support for uninstalling builds
- Add `static_link_options` to `static_library()` to specify options to pass to
  the static linker
- Add a `bfg9000 env` command to print the environment variables used during
  configuration
- Automatically request sudo elevation when installing builds to a system
  directory

### Breaking changes
- `directory()` and `header_directory()` no longer automatically include all
  files within them (pass `include='*'` for the old behavior)
- The `include` argument for compiling object files has been replaced by
  `includes`
- When creating a static library, `link_options` now specifies options that will
  be forwarded along to the dynamic linker, rather than options for the static
  linker itself
- The `options` argument for `test()`/`test_driver()` has been deprecated; add
  any options to the first argument (`cmd`) instead
- `test()` no longer converts its first argument to a `generic_file()`
- Splitting POSIX shell strings (used for compile and link options as well as
  environment vars on POSIX like `CPPFLAGS`) no longer parses escape characters

### Bug fixes
- Improve logging of syntax errors in `build.bfg` files
- Fix usage of nested shared libraries when linking with GNU ld (via
  `-rpath-link`)
- Installing directories from the srcdir now correctly installs their contents
  to the installation root for that type (e.g. a header directory of `foo/bar`
  installs its contents to `$includedir`)
- Fix generation of dependencies for the `tests` target
- Improve escaping for paths when using Make on Windows (previously users had
  to escape backslashes themselves)
- Fix an issue with quotation marks being stripped for some commands on Windows
  with the Ninja backend

- `env.compiler(lang)` replaced by `env.builder(lang).compiler`
- `env.linker(lang, mode)` replaced by `env.builder(lang).linker(mode)`
- `env.compiler(lang).flavor` replaced by `env.builder(lang).flavor`

### Bug fixes
