# Most significant projects require the use of external libraries. You can find
# these libraries on the system with the package() function:

ogg = package('ogg')

# Packages can be passed to the build functions, which will link the object
# with the package and add the appropriate include directories:

executable('program', files=['program.cpp'], packages=[ogg])
