# It's important to have tests for your code! Any executable can be run as a
# test by passing it to the test() function:

test( executable('prog', files=['prog.cpp']) )

# In addition, you can provide a test driver that collects all of your tests
# together and runs them as one. In this case, we just test a Python script
# using the `python` command, but you're free to use any test driver you like
# (including ones built by the executable() function in bfg9000!).

driver = test_driver(source_file('script.py'))
test(generic_file('test_data.txt'), driver=driver)
