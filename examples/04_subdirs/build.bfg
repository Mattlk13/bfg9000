# Many projects have their code split up into multiple directories. For source
# files, this is easy: just write out the relative path to the file. For header
# files, however, the build needs to know where to search for the headers. The
# header_directory() function creates a reference to a directory that can then
# be passed to the build functions:

include = header_directory('include', include='**/*.hpp')

# Built files can also be added to subdirectories:

lib = shared_library('sub/library', files=['src/library.cpp'],
                     includes=[include])
prog = executable('sub/program', files=['src/program.cpp'], includes=[include],
                  libs=[lib])

install(prog, lib, include)
