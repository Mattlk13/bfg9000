# When using external packages, you may want to specify how to get them from a
# remote source (e.g. a package manager). To do this, you use the package()
# function as normal, but also specify how to resolve the package dependency in
# mopack.yml. This makes it easier for people building your project to override
# how package dependencies are resolved.
